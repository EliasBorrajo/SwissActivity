<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>We are a team of 4 Swiss programmers who are passionate about culture and discovery. Our mission is to help you discover the many events taking place in our country by providing you with an API that informs you about events happening within a 30 km radius of your location.</p>

<p>Our company, which has been in business for 3 weeks, has its offices located at the HES in Sierre. We are proud to contribute to the cultural and associative fabric of our region by allowing people to discover new activities and events in their immediate environment.</p>

<p>In addition to this main activity, we also offer internships to help people manage the creation of 20 projects in a very short time. We believe that our collaborative and dynamic approach is the key to helping people achieve their goals.</p>
